            <p>The Moon is an astronomical body orbiting Earth and is the planet's only natural satellite. It is the

            <p>The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely
                accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between
                Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia. New research of Moon rocks, although not
                rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought.</p>

            <p>The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, and thus always shows the same side to Earth, the near
                side. Because of libration, slightly more than half (about 59%) of the total lunar surface can be viewed
                from Earth.[15] The near side is marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright
                ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. After the Sun, the Moon is the
                second-brightest celestial object regularly visible in Earth's sky.</p>

                <p>The Moon's average orbital distance is 384,402 km (238,856 mi),[16][17] or 1.28 light-seconds. This
                    is about thirty times the diameter of Earth. The Moon's apparent size in the sky is almost the same
                    as that of the Sun, since the star is about 400 times the lunar distance and diameter. Therefore,
                    the Moon covers the Sun nearly precisely during a total solar eclipse. This matching of apparent
                    visual size will not continue in the far future because the Moon's distance from Earth is gradually
                    increasing.</p>
