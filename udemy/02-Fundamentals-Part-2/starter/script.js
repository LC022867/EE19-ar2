//ACTIVATING STRICT MODE

/*Strict mode is a special mode that we can activate in Javascript, which makes it easier for us to write secure Javascript codes.

To activate strict mode we need to use this: 'useÂ strict';

It makes it easier for developers to avoid accidental errors. It helps to introduce the bugs into our code.

Reasons are:

 1. it will actually create visible errors for us

 2. Strict mode forbids us to do certain things

Without strict mode it will simply fail silently without letting us know what we did a mistake.
